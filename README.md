## Futur Junior web developer

Just a girl who discovers this world and having fun, as with anything new she explores!

### My exceptional talents:

- Loosing my keys juste after finding them
- Always up for new experiences
- Questioning myself whether penguins have knees when it's time to sleep. 


### Things I could die for :

-  A good agricultural rhum.
-  Time to do things that make me feel alive.
-  Food, more food!

### My objectives during the training : 

No matter what happens, dont forget that "~What the hell is this?! I'm never going to make it!~ "Everything is gonna be just fine, just breathe and don't give up."

### The monsters under my bed :

* Social anxiety
* Walking throught a puddle in socks 

	... are proud to present their [newborn](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Johnson-09-main-repo/tree/main/1.The-Field/01-Setup/Day%2002/package-manage)

Can't wait to look back 7 months from now and say to myself :
I did it! What an incredible experience! I'm going to miss it!.

### The Three things you value the most to work as a team :
1. Autonomy
2. Collaboration
3. Still believe in kindness
