*Just a girl who discovers this world and having fun, as with anything new she explores!*

### My objectives during the training : 

No matter what happens, dont forget that "~What the hell is this?! I'm never going to make it!~ "Everything is gonna be ok, just breathe and don't give up!"

### The monsters under my bed :
